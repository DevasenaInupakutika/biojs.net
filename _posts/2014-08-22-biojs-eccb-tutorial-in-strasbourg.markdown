BioJS is an open source community project aiming to create a collection of JavaScript components that present biological information following a common guideline. This workshop introduces the BioJS project and provides the tools and knowledge to get started using and developing BioJS components. 

[official ECCB T06 page](http://www.eccb14.org/program/tutorials/biojs)

Audience
---------

This tutorial is for bioinformaticians and developers interested in presenting biological information on the web. Basic programming knowledge is required to attend this tutorial. Though the workshop can be easily followed without no knowledge in JavaScript, it would be desirable to have some scripting experience in JavaScript. 

Learning objectives
--------------------

Learn how to use BioJS components and get a taste on how to create a BioJS component. 

Requirements
------------

* your own laptop
* sun glasses (for the social after-hour party) :-)

Timeline (06.09)
--------

9:00 - 9:45 -- __Introduction to the BioJS project (MC+RJ)__: Here we show BioJS’s approach to visualising biological data and how this makes it easier for target users to reutilise, share and develop JavaScript software using the BioJS framework. We will introduce some representative use cases.

9:45 - 10:15 -- __BioJS registry (SW+DD):__ will show how to use the BioJS registry (central package exchange point), how it is used and its benefits. 

10:15 - 10:45 -- Coffee break 

10:45 - 11:25 -- __BioJS components (DD+SW):__ Tree Viewer (DD) + MSA (SW) + Combination

11:25 - 12:00 -- __Developer environment setup (SW+DD+RJ)__: Check that everybody has [all they need][setup] for the coding part (git, npm); clone BioJS GitHub repository

[setup]: http://edu.biojs.net/tutorials/01_gettingStarted.html

12:30 - 1:00 -- __Coding session I:__ A "Hello World" component (SW+DD+RJ). An introductory example for a component from scratch. (Following the examples from BioJS EDU)

1:00 - 2:00 -- Lunch - 60 minutes

2:00 - 3:00 -- __Design exercise__ Here students work on their own ideas or an interesting (given) but simple example, with pen and paper. We would require big paper sheets for further discussion and creative input. We give people the freedom to start coding whenever they want.

3:00 - 3:30 -- Coffee break - 30 minutes

3:30 - 4:30 -- __Coding session II:__ Developing a BioJS component. Groups start working on the example worked on in the previous session. 

4:30 - 5:00 -- __Wrap up (MC+RJ)__: We collect feedback about current BioJS components, improvements and future applications. We also tell students how to become involved in the BioJS community.

__Social after-hour party__ (don’t forget your sunglasses!)
