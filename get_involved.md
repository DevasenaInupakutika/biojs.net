How to contribute
---------------

For now here is a simple formula:

1. Fork any BioJS repository at [Github](https://github.com/biojs/)
2. Do awesomeness!
3. Send a pull request to [`biojs`](https://github.com/biojs/)
4. If we merge your pull request, you get commit access. BAM. Go back to step 2 and stay there as long as you want.

Otherwise you can simply [create your own component](http://edu.biojs.net/series/101_graduate/02_package_basics.html) and [add it to our registry](http://edu.biojs.net/series/101_graduate/05_publish_it.html).
